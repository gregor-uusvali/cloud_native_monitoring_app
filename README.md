# DevOps Project: Deploying Cloud Native Monitoring Application on Kubernetes

### Overview
This DevOps project demonstrates the deployment of a Cloud Native Monitoring Application on a Kubernetes cluster. Monitoring is a crucial aspect of any cloud-native or containerized application, providing real-time insights into the health and performance of your services. Kubernetes, with its orchestration capabilities, is an ideal platform for managing such applications.

In this project, we will set up a Kubernetes cluster and deploy a monitoring application using a user-friendly interface for visualization and alerting.
